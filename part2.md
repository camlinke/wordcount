# Flask by Example, Part 2 - Postgres, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic

Welcome! Today we're going to build an app using Flask with a simple text box that you enter text into and the app processes and displays a count of how many times each word appears on the page.

1. In part one, we'll set up a local development environment and then deploy both a staging environment and a production environment on Heroku.
2. In part two, we'll set up our PostgreSQL database along with SQLAlchemy as our ORM and Alembic to handle migrations.
3. In part three, we'll be doing a bunch of backend processing to count the words of a web page so weâ€™ll implement a request queue that will do the actual processing of the words.

## Install Requirements

In this section we're going to get our database set up to store the results of our word counts. Along the way we'll set up a Postgres database, set up SQLAlchemy to use as an ORM, and use Alembic for our data migrations.

Tools we'll use in this part:

- Postgres - [http://www.postgresql.org/](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- Psycopg - [http://initd.org/psycopg/](http://initd.org/psycopg/)
- SQLAlchemy - [http://www.sqlalchemy.org/](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- Alembic - [http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- Flask-Migrate - [http://flask-migrate.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](http://flask-migrate.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

To get started install Postgres on your local computer if you don't have it already. Since Heroku uses Postgres it will be good for us to develop locally on the same database. If you don't have Postgres installed, [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/) is an easy way to get up and running quick for Mac users. Once you have Postgres installed and running, create a database called *wordcount_dev* to use as our local development database. In order to use our newly created database in the Flask app we're going to need to install a few things:

```
$ workon wordcount
$ pip install psycopg2
$ pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
$ pip install Flask-Migrate
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Psycopg is is a Python adapter for Postgres, SQLAlchemy is an awesome Python ORM, and Flask-Migrate will install both that extension and Alembic which we'll use for our database migrations.

## Update Configuration

Add the following line to the `Config()` class in your *config.py* file to set your app to use your newly created database in development (local), staging, and production:

```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']
```

Also make sure to add the following import:

```python
import os
```

Your config file should now look like this:

```python
import os

class Config(object):
    DEBUG = False
    TESTING = False
    CSRF_ENABLED = True
    SECRET_KEY = 'this-really-needs-to-be-changed'
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

class ProductionConfig(Config):
    DEBUG = False

class StagingConfig(Config):
    DEVELOPMENT = True
    DEBUG = True

class DevelopmentConfig(Config):
    DEVELOPMENT = True
    DEBUG = True

class TestingConfig(Config):
    TESTING = True
```

Now when our config gets loaded into our app the appropriate database will be connected to it as well.

Similar to how we added an environment variable in the last post we are going to add a `DATABASE_URL` variable to our *postactivate* file. Using VIM you can do this in the following way:

1. Open your file in VIM:

  ```
  $ vi $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/postactivate
  ```

2. Press 'i' on your keyboard to insert text and add the following line to your file:

  ```
  export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/wordcount_dev"
  ```

3. Now hit escape, type ':' then 'wq', and press enter to save and close VIM.

4. Restart your environment:

  ```
  $ workon wordcount
  ```

Now in your *app.py* file import SQLAlchemy and connect the database:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

from models import Result

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

@app.route('/<name>')
def hello_name(name):
    return "Hello {}!".format(name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Model

Set up a basic model to hold the results of the wordcount by adding a *models.py* file:

```python
from app import db
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSON

class Result(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'results'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    url = db.Column(db.String())
    result_all = db.Column(JSON)
    result_no_stop_words = db.Column(JSON)

    def __init__(self, url, result_all, result_no_stop_words):
        self.url = url
        self.result_all = result_all
        self.result_no_stop_words = result_no_stop_words

    def __repr__(self):
        return '<id %r>' % self.id
```

What we are doing here is creating a table to store the results of our wordcount. We first import the database connection that we created in our *app.py* file as well as JSON from sqlalchemy's postgresql dialects. JSON columns are fairly new to Postgres and are not available in every database supported by SQLAlchemy so we need to import it specifically.

Next we create a `Result()` class and assign it a table name of `results`. We then set the attributes that we want to store for a result - the id of the result we stored, the url that we counted the words of, a full list of words that we counted, and a list of words that we counted minus stop words (more on this later).

We then create an `__init__()` method that will run the first time we create a new result and, finally, a `__repr__()` method to represent the object when we query for it.

## Local Migration

We are going to use Alembic and Flask-Migrate to migrate our database to the latest version. Alembic is migration library for SQLAlchemy and could be used without Flask-Migrate if you want. However Flask-Migrate does help with some of the setup and makes things easier.

Create a new file called *manage.py*:

```python
from flask.ext.script import Manager
from flask.ext.migrate import Migrate, MigrateCommand
import os

from app import app, db
app.config.from_object(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
manager = Manager(app)

manager.add_command('db', MigrateCommand)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    manager.run()
```

In order to use Flask-Migrate we need to import `Manager` as well as `Migrate` and `MigrateCommand` to our *manage.py* file. We also import `app` and `db` so we have access to them within our manage script.

First we set our config to get our environment based on the environment variabile and create a migrate instance with `app` and `db` as the arguments and set up a `manager` command to initialize a `Manager` instance for our app. Finally we add the `db` command to our manager so that we can run our migrations from the command line.

In order to run our migrations initialize Alembic:

```
$ python manage.py db init
  Creating directory /wordcount/migrations ... done
  Creating directory /wordcount/migrations/versions ... done
  Generating /wordcount/migrations/alembic.ini ... done
  Generating /wordcount/migrations/env.py ... done
  Generating /wordcount/migrations/env.pyc ... done
  Generating /wordcount/migrations/README ... done
  Generating /wordcount/migrations/script.py.mako ... done
  Please edit configuration/connection/logging settings in '/wordcount/migrations/alembic.ini' before proceeding.
```

After you run the database initialization you will see a new folder called "migrations" in the project. This holds the setup necessary for Alembic to run migrations on the project. Inside of "migrations" you will see that it has a folder called "versions", containing the migration scripts as they are created.

Let's create our first migration by running the `migrate` command.

```
$ python manage.py db migrate
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
  INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'results'
  Generating /wordcount/migrations/versions/20ff8063fe45_.py ... done
```

Now you'll notice in your "versions" folder there is a migration file. This file is autogenerated by Alembic based on the model. You could generate this file yourself; however, for a lot of cases the autogenerated file will do.

Now we'll apply our upgrades to our database using the `db upgrade` command:

```
$ python manage.py db upgrade
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Running upgrade None -> 20ff8063fe45, empty message
```

Our database is now ready for us to use in our app.

## Remote Migration

Finally we are going to apply these migrations to our Heroku databases.

First, though, we need to add the details or our staging and production databases to our *config.py* file. To check if you have a database set up on your staging server run:

```
$ heroku config --app wordcount-stage
=== wordcount-stage Config Vars
APP_SETTINGS: config.StagingConfig
```

*Make sure to replace `wordcount-stage` with the name of your staging app.*

Since we don't see anything about a database, we need to add the Postgres addon to the staging server. To do so, run the following to add the Postgres addon to your heroku app:

```
$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev --app wordcount-stage
  Adding heroku-postgresql:dev on wordcount-stage... done, v8 (free)
  Attached as HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL
  Database has been created and is available
   ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
   ! data from another database with pgbackups:restore.
  Use `heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql:dev` to view documentation.
```

Now when we run heroku config again we should see the connection settings for our URL.

For example:

```
APP_SETTINGS:                config.StagingConfig
DATABASE_URL:                postgres://eccqpmccvlokrj:d0iLgQB8naQ2Pg8HL4q61G9gOd@ec2-54-235-250-41.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dep90ehmacu89e
HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_AMBER_URL: postgres://eccqpmccvlokrj:d0iLgQB8naQ2Pg8HL4q61G9gOd@ec2-54-235-250-41.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dep90ehmacu89e
```

Next we need to commit the changes that you've made to git and push to your staging server:

```
$ git push stage master
```

Finally run the migrations that we created to migrate our staging database. We do this by using the `heroku run` command to run python scripts within our heroku app. We will use this to run the same `db upgrade` command from our *manage.py* file.

```
$ heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app wordcount-stage
  Running `python manage.py db upgrade` attached to terminal... up, run.4755
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
  INFO  [alembic.migration] Running upgrade None -> 20ff8063fe45, empty message
```

Note how we only ran the upgrade, not the `init` or `migrate` commands like before. We already have our migration setup and ready to go, we only need to run it on our heroku database.

Let's now do the same for our production site. Set up a database for your production app. Push your changes to your production site. Notice how you don't have to make any changes to your config file - it's setting the database based on the newly created `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

Run your migrations on your production server:

```
$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev --app wordcount-pro
$ git push pro master
$ heroku run python manage.py db upgrade --app wordcount-pro
```

Now both our our staging and production sites have their databases set up and are migrated and ready to go.

## Sanity Check

Remember in Part 1, when we tested the environment variables to make sure right environment was being detected by adding a print statment to *app.py* - `print os.environ['APP_SETTINGS']`? Well, let's do the same thing, but test the Database URIs by adding a print to *config.py*:

```python
print os.environ['DATABASE_URL']
```

Now let's test.

**Local**:

```
$ python config.py
postgresql://localhost/wordcount_dev
```

**Staging**:

```
$ heroku run python config.py  --app wordcount-stage
Running `python config.py` attached to terminal... up, run.1572
postgres://eccqpmccvlokrj:d0iLgQB8naQ2Pg8HL4q61G9gOd@ec2-54-235-250-41.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dep90ehmacu89e
```

**Production**:

```
$ heroku run python config.py  --app wordcount-pro
Running `python config.py` attached to terminal... up, run.3993
postgres://rsjezmhdfavadr:_ams4r9uEHXcGCZOcnDqqD6Pxs@ec2-54-235-250-41.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d6dpkb5kmd7bg9
```

The URIs for the staging and production should match the URIs displayed when we ran the `heroku` config commands:

```
$ heroku config --app wordcount-stage
```

and

```
$ heroku config --app wordcount-pro
```

## Conclusion

That's it for part 2. I hope database migrations make better sense now. Please comment below with questions.

In Part 3 we're going to build the word counting functionality and have it sent to a request queue to deal with the longer running wordcount processing. See you next time.

Best!
